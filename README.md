This is a simple chat app, the user logs in using his or her gmail account and is then able to send messages.
All users send messages to the same location and can see all other messages, in this respect it resembles
a livestream chat or facebook group chat. Users can see message updates in real time  via the useCollectionData
hook which listens for changes in the database.
